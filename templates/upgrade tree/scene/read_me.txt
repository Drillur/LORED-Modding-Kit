The root node must match the key of the Upgrade Tree it is associated with.

The ScrollContainer must either be the root node or the very first child of the
root node.

To have Upgrade Nodes appear in-game, place Control nodes in the scene matching
their Upgrade's key. I used Panels so that they would be visible. You may use
any Control node. Do not use a node type which does not extend Control.
